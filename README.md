# Flask Restful Template
A template that I use when I start flask restful projects.

- It utilizes expression and statement delimiters in the template html files.
- Contains a basic bootstrap layout file
- Contains basic login/register with hashed password saving
- Contains profile editing system using sqlalchemy with sqlite (which can be easily adapted to other database engines)
- Utilizes JWT and CSRF tokens

A good start point for a website or flask API backend project.
